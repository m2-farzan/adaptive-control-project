# Adaptive Control Project
Final project for Adaptive Control Systems course, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IUST (Spring 2021)

State: Finished â€” [Final Report (Farsi)](https://github.com/m2-farzan/adaptive-control-project/releases/download/r1/farzan-mahmoodtabar-project-report-r1.pdf)

## Intro

In this project, the adaptive control methods described in papers [1-3] were analysed. Also, the controller described in [1] was implemented and tested in a simulation.
